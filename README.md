# Learning graph isomorphisms using neural networks

Both the python and jupyter notebook versions are uploaded. The generate_training_data.py is used for generating the test and training data. The symmetry_1.py is just the updated code for learning isomorphism class. It does the same job as symmetry.py but it is much faster. I have included the test and training data for graph of node size 5. The training data for graph of node size 6 and 7 are huge to include here and also some work (not concept related) is still pending.
